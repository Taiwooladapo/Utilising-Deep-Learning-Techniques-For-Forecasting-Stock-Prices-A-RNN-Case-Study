# Utilising-Deep-Learning-Techniques-For-Forecasting-Stock-Prices-A-RNN-Case-Study
This project focuses on the exploration of the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for stock price forecasting. Deep learning has the potential to capture intricate patterns and extract meaningful features from large-scale datasets. The RNN model was utilised to learn patterns and relationships in historical stock price data. The model was evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its accuracy and robustness. The project uses the Apple stock price dataset from 1980 to 2022. This dataset is applied to the training of the RNN model and evaluated using the following data analytic metrics: ”Mean Absolute Error” (MAE), ”Mean Squared Error” (MSE), and ”Root Mean Squared Error” (RMSE) metrics. The evaluation indicates that the RNN model can predict stock prices for the future with some degree of accuracy. The findings associated with the research highlight the power of deep learning techniques for stock price forecasting. However, further work is required to fine-tune the performance of the model and to develop more robust models.
# WorkFlow
Knowledge Discovery Database (KDD) methodology was used as the foundation for the research. The primary goal of this methodology is to get insightful conclusions and useful information from the Apple Stock price data. This information is essential for data visualization, predictions, and creating a reliable stock price forecasting model. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a particular kind of deep learning framework was used. RNNs are good at working with sequential data, which makes them suitable for time series forecasting tasks like predicting stock prices. The strategy included several crucial phases in the RNN model’s framework which are highlighted below:
1. Data Collection: This is the first step in any data-driven research project. It is a crucial step because the research focuses on predicting stock prices and obtaining a reliable dataset is very important in our predictions. Apple Stock data is used in this research, and it is publicly available on the Kaggle website. The dataset consists of 10,468 observations and 7 columns. Its parameters include Date, Open, High, Close, Low, Adj Close, and Volume.
2. Data Preprocessing: This is the second stage of the methodology, which helps prepare the data for evaluation. Different steps are carried out in this stage, and it is highlighted below:
(i) Data Cleaning: This was done to handle missing values or any inconsistencies in the data. However, the data set was found to be free of missing values or duplicated rows.
(ii) Data Transformation: This was done to ensure the data is in a suitable format for the model. Here, the column data types were explored, the date type was corrected from object to date, and the ’Date’ column was set as the index.
(iii) Data Scaling: This was implemented due to the sensitivity of RNNs to the scale of input variables. MinMaxScaling was used for this process.
(iv) Data Splitting: To evaluate the RNN model performance, data splitting must be performed. The dataset is then randomly divided into two sets, Training and Testing, into 80% (0.8) and 20% (0.2) ratios.
Some important points to take note are as follows:
(i) The architecture associated with the RNN model is implemented using the Sequential() class from a library called Keras.
(ii) The model comprises an LSTM (”Long Short-Term Memory”) layer, an RNN layer capable of capturing temporal dependencies in sequential data.
(iii) The model is trained through the training data and evaluated with the help of appropriate evaluation metrics.
(iv) Visualization techniques are used to visually analyse the historical trends, predicted values, and any discrepancies between the predicted and actual closing prices.
3. The LSTM (RNN) Modelling: This section discusses the deep learning model used in this project. RNNs, or Recurrent Neural Networks, mainly the LSTM model, have been utilised, and they are highly suitable for stock price forecasting due to their ability to capture temporal dependencies and learn patterns from sequential data. They offer several advantages for this problem:
(i) Sequential Data Handling: RNNs excel at processing and analysing sequential data, making them well-suited for stock price data in which the order of data points is essential. They maintain an internal memory that allows them to retain information from previous inputs, enabling them to capture the temporal dependencies in stock price data.
(ii) Long-Term Dependency Capture: The stock market exhibits long-term trends and patterns, and RNNs, especially those with LSTM layers, are designed to capture and learn these dependencies. LSTM layers have gating mechanisms determining which information to remember or forget, enabling them to handle long sequences and capture relevant patterns over extended periods.
(iii) Stock price data can have varying lengths, varying from company to company. RNNs can handle variable length inputs by processing sequences of different lengths through time steps. This flexibility makes them suitable for handling stock price data, which can have different historical data availability and lengths for different companies.
(iv) Feature Extraction: RNNs, as deep learning models, can automatically extract meaningful features from large-scale datasets. This capability is particularly useful for stock price forecasting as RNNs can identify complex patterns, hidden relationships, and subtle indicators within the data. Leveraging hierarchical representations learned by the network, RNNs can uncover valuable insights to aid in accurate predictions.
(v) Adaptability to Changing Market Dynamics: The stock market is influenced by several factors, and its dynamics can change over time. RNNs can adapt and update their internal states as new information becomes available. This adaptability makes them suitable for forecasting stock prices as they continuously learn from the most recent data, allowing them to adjust their predictions accordingly.
4. Evaluation and Results: The RNN model achieved a “Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 11.97, a ”Mean Squared Error” (MSE) of 483.20, and a ”Root Mean Squared Error” (RMSE) of 21.98. These metrics provide insights into the average magnitude and overall difference between the predicted and actual closing prices. While these values indicate some level of error in the predictions, they also demonstrate the model’s ability to capture and learn patterns from the Apple Stock data.
# Tools Used
1. Google Colab: An interactive environment where the project code was performed.
2. Python: This is a programming language that was used for the analysis with libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Seaborn, matplotlib, pandas and numpy.
# Limitations and Future Work
This project aimed to explore the effectiveness of deep learning techniques, specifically using an RNN model, for stock price forecasting. The findings indicate that deep learning techniques can be used to forecast stock prices with some accuracy. However, the performance of the RNN model is sensitive to hyperparameter selection and the training dataset. The project’s limitations include focusing on a single stock (Apple) and using only historical data for training. The results may differ for other stocks, and changing market conditions may affect the model’s ability to predict future stock prices. Despite these limitations, the project provides valuable insights. It emphasises the importance of using a large and diverse training dataset, carefully tuning hyperparameters, and exploring methods for incorporating exogenous factors into deep learning models for stock price forecasting. Overall, the project contributes to stock price forecasting by demonstrating the potential of deep learning techniques, highlighting the factors influencing model performance, and suggesting avenues for future research.
